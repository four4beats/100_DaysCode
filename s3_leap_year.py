# Angela suggests using a flow chart to visualize the logic.
# Angela's solution code looked like this:
# if year % 4 == 0:
#     if year % 100 == 0:
#         if year % 400 == 0:
#             print("Leap year.")
#         else:
#             print("Not leap year.")
#     else:
#         print("Leap year.")
# else:
#     print("Not leap year.")
